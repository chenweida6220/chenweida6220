# Tableau

| Project Link | Project Description | Deliverable Link |
|---|---|---| 
| üé¨ [Netflix Movies & TV Shows](https://github.com/chenweida6220/Netflix-Movies-TV-Shows-Analysis) | Analyzed and visualized Netflix‚Äôs catalog of movies and TV shows using two datasets from Kaggle, covering content from 2021 and extending through 2025. Using Excel and Tableau, I explored trends in content growth, ratings, popularity, genres, and global distribution to uncover insights into Netflix‚Äôs evolving content strategy and viewer preferences. The analysis revealed a tenfold increase in titles since 2008, with movies comprising nearly 70 percent of the catalog and ‚ÄúDrama‚Äù emerging as the dominant genre across both datasets. Results also showed that most titles received ratings between 7 and 8 out of 10, indicating generally positive user feedback, while the weak correlation between popularity and ratings suggested that high viewership does not always align with high quality. | [Tableau Dashboard (Data till 2021)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wei.da.chen/viz/NetflixMoviesTVShowsTill2021/Netflix), [Tableau Dashboard (Data till 2025)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wei.da.chen/viz/NetflixMoviesTVShowsTill2025/Netflix) |
| üíâ [Diabetes Risk](https://github.com/chenweida6220/diabetes-risk-visualization) | Analyzed data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to identify key risk factors for diabetes among U.S. adults. Using Excel and Tableau, I cleaned and visualized over 441,000 survey responses to uncover relationships between diabetes prevalence and variables such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and education level. The analysis revealed that higher BMI and blood pressure were strongly associated with diabetes, while higher education levels appeared protective. The project transformed complex public health data into clear visuals to support awareness and prevention efforts. | [Slide Presentation](https://github.com/chenweida6220/diabetes-risk-visualization/blob/main/COOP%20Diabetes%20Data%20Visualization%20Project.pdf), [Project Report](https://github.com/chenweida6220/diabetes-risk-visualization/blob/main/Visualizing%20Diabetes%20Risk%20-%20An%20Analysis%20of%20CDC%E2%80%99s%202015%20BRFSS%20Data.pdf) |
| ü¶† [Telecoms Campaign Optimization](https://github.com/chenweida6220/telecoms-campaign-optimization-analysis) | Analyzed over 1,000 telecommunications marketing campaign records to identify spatial and audience-based performance patterns across U.S. regions. Using Excel and Tableau, I conducted geospatial and segmentation analyses that revealed more than 20 performance anomalies and over 10 low-performing states, leading to a 15% improvement in targeting strategy. By cleaning and integrating multiple datasets, I uncovered actionable insights across audience, creative, and inventory dimensions, and presented over a dozen strategic recommendations that contributed to a projected 20% increase in ROI. The project demonstrated how data-driven optimization can enhance campaign efficiency and guide smarter marketing investments. | [Slide Presentation](https://github.com/chenweida6220/telecoms-campaign-optimization-analysis/blob/main/COOP%20Data%20Analyst%20-%20Capstone.pdf), [Project Report](https://github.com/chenweida6220/telecoms-campaign-optimization-analysis/blob/main/COOP%20Capstone%20Project%20-%20One%20Pager.pdf) |
